<h1 class="head">🧋 Blog Post 1: Bubble Tea Breaks and Shared Moments</h1>
<div class="sel"><h2> <span class="h2">More Than Just a Drink</span></h2>
Bubble tea has become a global phenomenon, but at its heart, it’s about joy.
Two cups held up together, straws puncturing the sealed lids, pearls 
waiting at the bottom — it’s a ritual that feels both playful and comforting.

<h2><span class="h2">Work and Play in Harmony</span></h2>
The backdrop of laptops and papers tells a familiar story: work is happening, 
deadlines are near. Yet, the bubble tea cups stand out as symbols of balance. 
They remind us that productivity isn’t just about pushing through; it’s about 
knowing when to pause, recharge, and share a sweet moment with someone else.

<h2><span class="h2">The Social Ritual</span></h2>
Bubble tea is rarely enjoyed alone. Whether it’s milk tea, fruit tea, or a 
mix with jelly pieces, the joy lies in sharing. The act of holding up the cups 
together, almost like a toast, transforms the drink into a social ritual. It’s 
a way of saying: we’re in this together, let’s enjoy the ride.

<h2><span class="h2">Closing Reflection</span></h2> 
In the rush of modern life, bubble tea becomes more than a beverage. It’s a 
reminder that the best breaks are shared, and the sweetest productivity hacks 
come in the form of pearls and tea.
